## Introduction
This repository contains my coursework and group projects for MIS-301: Programming in Python for Business (Q4 2024–2025). The course emphasizes applying Python programming to solve business-related problems through data analysis, cleaning, and visualization.

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Project 1 – Data Exploration with Python** : An introductory project focused on exploring a chosen dataset using foundational Python skills. This includes working with data types, control flows, NumPy, and Pandas to analyze data and extract meaningful insights.

- **Project 2 – YouTube Sentiment Analysis** : A project analyzing YouTube video performance and audience comments to understand sentiment distribution, audience engagement, and factors driving virality. The project involved combining and cleaning datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating actionable recommendations for a non-technical business audience.

This collection serves as a reference for my learning journey in Python.
